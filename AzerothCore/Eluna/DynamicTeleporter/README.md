- Icon support in menus

---

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Supports both **NPC** and **item** interactions

## ðŸ§± Structure

The menu data is defined in a Lua table like this:

```lua
local T = {
  [1] = { "Menu Title", TeamRestriction,
    {"Display text", mapId, x, y, z, orientation, costInCopper},
  },
  [2] = { "Another Menu", TeamRestriction,
    {"Another location", mapId, x, y, z, o, cost},
  },
}


0 = Alliance only

1 = Horde only

2 = Both
